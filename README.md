# online-inventory-PHP

An online inventory software with three platforms: Admin, Seller/Dispenser, and Cashier. 

1.  The Admin registers, creates user accounts, manages product inventory, sends products to the dispensary, and handles invoicing, reporting, expenses, and subscription payments. The Admin can also email the software owner, change passwords, and log out.

2.  The Seller/Dispenser platform allows users to be costing products, manage sales by confirming payment, check product quantities (sold, remaining, and initial), change passwords, and log out.

3.  The Cashier platform allows users to view product costs, collect payments, confirm payment status, generate sales reports (daily, weekly, quarterly, bi-annually, annually), change passwords, and log out."
